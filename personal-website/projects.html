            <p class="project-description">
              This project focused on the introduction of Java and JavaFX technologies. The 
              application simulates core functions of of a standard vending machine. 
              Supported operations include purchase and restocking with features like seeing 
              the the number of items remaining. Building this project was my first well 
              fleshed out application with proper documentation.

            <h2 class="project-label">STL Libraries - C++</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
              A deep exploration on C++'s standard libraries and their inner workings. This 
              involved rewrites of all the essential data structures such as std::string, 
              std::vectors, std::list, std::stack, std::queue, and std::unordered_map. This 
              also involved the introduction of concepts like time complexity, rule of five, 
              and memory management.
