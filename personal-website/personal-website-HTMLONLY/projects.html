            <p class="project-description">
              This project focused on the introduction of Java and JavaFX technologies. The 
              application simulates core functions of of a standard vending machine. 
              Supported operations include purchase and restocking with features like seeing 
              the the number of items remaining. Building this project was my first well 
              fleshed out application with proper documentation. If this is something that 
              you'd like to view, there is a full download and setup guide on the github 
              repository for you to follow.

            <h2 class="project-label">STL Libraries - C++</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
              A deep exploration on C++'s standard libraries and their inner workings. This 
              involved rewrites of all the essential data structures such as std::string, 
              std::vectors, std::list, std::stack, std::queue, and std::unordered_map. This 
              also involved the introduction of concepts like time complexity, rule of five, 
              and memory management. These implementations were done over the course of a 
              year across two classes, CSCE 121 and CSCE 221 at Texas A&M University. No 
              direct links to my implementations are provided for purpose of honoring the 
              Aggie Code of Honor and Code of Conduct.

            <h2 class="project-label">Groceries List App - ReactJS</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
              Web application that offers users a groceries list manager. The app 
              includes essential functionalities such as creating, updating, and deleting 
              list items. The UI is created in such a way to make the user experience as 
              efficient and comforting as possible by providing straightforward and easy to 
              access input methods as well as a search item ability should the user ever 
              need one. The list is always auto-saved when changes are made for the users' 
              convenience. Additionally, error handling messages are included for any 
              possible bugs.

            <h2 class="project-label">Discord Clone - C#</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
              Desktop application that was created with the intent of mimicking discord 
              app's core functionalities. These features include direct messaging, private 
              group messaging, and community/personal servers. Other accessibility features 
              included member lists for chats and convenient message and server scroll 
              lists. A database is used to allow for communication between unique devices. 
              This is a work in progress that is currently on pause. Future plans include 
              the implementations of voice and video chat as well as hopes for a live and 
              stable release.

            <h2 class="project-label">Friends Manager - Ruby on Rails</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
              Web application that allows individual users to create and manage a personal 
              friends or contacts list which can hold information like their name, phone 
              number, and email. The app is made functional with the employment of the 
              SQLite database. This was my first solo full stack development. Ruby on Rails 
              was chosen in particular for its simplicity and established communities.
