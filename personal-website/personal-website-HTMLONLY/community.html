            <h2>FBLA Color Run</h2>
            <p>
              Charity run hosted, planned, and built out by the Cinco Ranch High School 
              FBLA organization for the Katy community. A 5k run in which runners are showered 
              in colors to represent good health and happiness. Efforts of the charity event 
              led to raising thousands of dollars. As a result, the event became an annual 
              staple event at the high school for the entire community of Katy, Texas.

            <h2>Brookwood Community Service</h2>
            <p>
              Biweekly service which involved socializing and aiding in the daily lives of the 
              special needs community of Brookwood. Events held included aerobics, basketball, 
              biking, hiking, and board games. The experience brought new perspectives to the 
              different, but ultimately normal, lives of special needs people ranging ages 
              from young adults to senior members.
